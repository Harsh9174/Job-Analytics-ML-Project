# Job-Analytics-ML-Project

# Description
#### The Instahyre Job Market Analysis with Machine Learning project is an advanced version, where job data is scraped from the popular job portal Instahyre. In addition to collecting job postings, locations, and other important information, this project also incorporates a Machine Learning model using clustering algorithms.

#### The Machine Learning model is hosted using Streamlit, a web application framework, which allows users to interact with the model dynamically. The model takes inputs such as the number of company LinkedIn followers and the required experience level and then predicts the job class. Furthermore, users can use the search box to input skills, and the model will fetch relevant job details, displaying the most common experience levels, common workplaces, common job classes, and the total number of available jobs for that skill.

#### To ensure data accuracy and handle user input errors, a spell checker is integrated into the model. Even if users misspell skills, the model will provide the correct data. Python is the primary programming language used to develop the Machine Learning model and incorporate the spell checker.

# Key Features
* Web Scraping: The project utilizes web scraping techniques to collect job data from Instahyre, including job postings, locations, and relevant information.

* Data Cleaning and Analysis: The collected data is cleaned and processed, and a Machine Learning model using clustering algorithms is developed to identify job classes based on company LinkedIn followers and required experience.

* Streamlit Integration: The Machine Learning model is hosted using Streamlit, providing users with an interactive web application to predict job classes and fetch job details based on input skills.

* Spell Checker: A spell checker is integrated into the model to handle user input errors and provide accurate data even for misspelled skills.
